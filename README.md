Title: Exploring Global Nutrition: A Public Health Study üåçüçé

Introduction:

Welcome to the realm of public health research at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), where your role as a data analyst is instrumental in unraveling insights into global nutrition and addressing the challenge of undernutrition worldwide.

Project Overview:

As a newly appointed data analyst at FAO, you embark on a significant study led by Marc, an expert in nutrition and food security. The project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of worldwide nutrition, focusing particularly on undernutrition. Julien, the former data analyst, has laid the groundwork for this study, providing an outline, data, and a notebook with analysis steps.

Your task is to build upon Julien's work, utilizing either Python or R to conduct the analysis as per your preference. Marc encourages you to explore additional analyses beyond Julien's framework if you deem them relevant.

Deliverables:

Your deliverables for this project include:

Notebook in R Markdown or Jupyter (Python): This notebook should encompass all the analyses conducted and results obtained.

Notebook in PDF format: A PDF version of your notebook for documentation and presentation purposes.

Presentation support: A PowerPoint (PPT) or Google Slides presentation containing all the required information and insights derived from your analysis.

Project Workflow:

Review provided materials: Study the outline, data, lexicon, and notebook provided by Julien to understand the scope and direction of the analysis.

Choose your tool: Decide whether you will use Python or R for conducting the analysis, considering your familiarity and comfort with each language.

Explore and analyze data: Utilize the provided data to conduct exploratory data analysis, perform statistical analysis, and derive meaningful insights related to undernutrition worldwide.

Document your analysis: Organize your findings, code, and visualizations in the notebook, ensuring clarity and reproducibility of your work.

Create the presentation: Summarize your analysis, key insights, and recommendations in a visually appealing and informative presentation format.

Soutenance (Presentation):

During the oral presentation, the evaluator will role-play as Marc, the team leader, to assess your understanding and execution of the project. The presentation should last approximately 15 minutes, followed by a discussion and debriefing session.

Key Evaluation Criteria:

Methodology: Clarity and coherence in the approach to data exploration and analysis.
Data Manipulation: Proficiency in manipulating and analyzing DataFrame structures.
Use of Libraries: Demonstrated ability to leverage specialized libraries for data processing tasks.
Code Cleanliness: Organized and well-structured code with clear documentation.
GDPR Compliance: Awareness of data privacy regulations and adherence to GDPR principles in data handling and cleaning processes.
Conclusion:

Get ready to delve into the realm of public health research, where your analytical skills will contribute to understanding global nutrition patterns and combating undernutrition. Your dedication to this project will play a pivotal role in FAO's mission to create a world free from hunger. Good luck on your exploration journey! üåçüçé
